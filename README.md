# galaxy-project
I created a space/star project on processing. It looks like you are moving through space. 
I used the mouseX function to make it so that when you move you mouse across the x axis/horizontally
you will move faster through space and tha stars will look sped up
I tried to add a mouseClicked part so that it changes colors but I'm still in the process of figuring it out
